    <h3>Virat Kohli stunned the Indian cricketing fraternity with his decision to quit as Test captain following the three-match series against South Africa.
         Ahead of the series, many experts had predicted that this was India’s best chance to win in the Rainbow Nation considering the inexperience in the opposition camp.
          Moreover, while India began with an impressive 113-run triumph in Centurion, they failed to capitalize on the great start and lost the series 1-2. Despite the loss, Kohli quits with the record of having won most Tests as India’s captain – 40 out of 68. 
         With the 33-year-old reign as Indian captain coming to an end, we recap the rise and fall of Kohli.With MS Dhoni unavailable for the 1st Test of 2014/15 series in Australia, Kohli was handed the mantle of leadership for the Adelaide encounter. He responded to the responsibility with a hundred in each innings. India were set an improbable 364 to win the Test, but Kohli went after the target. As long as he was at the crease, India had hope. India were 242 for 2 in the chase at one stage, when Murali Vijay was dismissed for 99. The visitors crumbled after that, and, running out of partners, Kohli was seventh out at the score of 304.
          India slipped to 315 to lose the Test by 48 runs </h3><hr><hr>
